Using the ames housing data from a kaggle contest, exploring different house values for house flipping purposes.

Goto master and run: 
Ames_Data_project_notebook - this is the recap notebook
randome_forest_w2 <- this is the notebook I did all the random forest work in
lt_ames_model <- some lr to test my results from random_forest and used this to create charts and data for recap
